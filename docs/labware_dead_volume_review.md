# Labware dead-volume review

Every numeric `dead_volume_ul` in the checked-in catalogs has
`dead_volume_status: placeholder`. These are **unreviewed starting values for a
scientist to assess**, not qualified Bravo aspiration limits. Agilent describes
unusable volume as a plate-type recommended value and notes that the sample
liquid can require an adjustment ([Agilent, “Setting up a Normalization run”](https://automation.help.agilent.com/AutomationSolutionsKB13/am_solutions/utility_normalization.16.4.html)).
The values below are a local heuristic, not Agilent recommendations or Labcyte
Echo specifications. Review the plate geometry, liquid, head, tips, and method
before marking a value `reviewed` or using it to justify an aspiration.

For a recorded positive well capacity, the seed is 5% of that capacity, rounded
to one decimal µL. Where capacity is missing or zero in the catalog, the seed
is 5 µL for 384 wells or 10 µL for 96 wells. A missing capacity needs its own
review; the placeholder does not establish that the well can hold the sample.
The 1536-well fallback would be 0.3 µL if its capacity were missing. New liquid
labware with fewer than 96 wells receives a 25 µL placeholder until reviewed.

The active local catalog contains the following 10 liquid rows. Its other
eight rows are listed in the exclusion table below.

| Catalog source | ID | Liquid labware | Recorded well capacity (µL) | Dead-volume placeholder (µL) | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Snapshot | `lw-3918306f45b8` | 1536 Labcyte LP-0400 LDV | 5.5 | 0.3 | 5% of recorded capacity, rounded |

| Overlay | `lw-fba7222815b4` | 96AM Tip Wash Station | 250 | 12.5 | Liquid-bearing wash wells; 5% of recorded capacity |

When both Mongo and the local snapshot have no labware rows, the separate
built-in fallback contains these two liquid plates:

| ID | Liquid labware | Recorded well capacity (µL) | Dead-volume placeholder (µL) | Basis |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `builtin-384-greiner-781091` | 384 Greiner 781091 PS uclear | 130 | 6.5 | 5% of recorded capacity |
| `builtin-96-greiner-655101` | 96 Greiner 655101 PS Clr Rnd Well Flat Btm | 300 | 15.0 | 5% of recorded capacity |

The editor YAML and Mongo seed JSON repeat some snapshot rows. Their nested
`well_dimensions_mm.dead_volume_ul` values match the snapshot rows above; each
also carries `well_dimensions_mm.dead_volume_status: placeholder`. Existing
Mongo rows without a recorded value receive the same heuristic in the runtime
catalog and in the editable labware list. A value already entered in Mongo is
preserved, and a value without explicit `reviewed` status remains a placeholder.

The following catalog rows have **no numeric dead volume** because they are
tip racks, cartridge fixtures, or loading accessories rather than liquid
source plates. Their `kind` happens to be `sbs_plate` in some vendor records,
so `kind` alone is not evidence that they hold aspiratable liquid.
